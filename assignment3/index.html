  <h1 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive;">Gen Z loves Fast Fashion</h1>

  <p>
    Fast Fashion is a problem mainly amoung Gen Z, who are both eco-consious and 
    drawn to affordable trends, being one I can relate. Brands like Shein and Temu offer
    low-priced clothing that appeal to younger consumers seeking to stay fashionable without 
    overspending.</p>
  <p>
   Although awareness of fast fashions negative impact is growing, studies show that when
   young people learn about the environmental harm caused by brands like Shein, they are less likely 
   to buy from them. With more people bringing these issues to light, we can reduce the harm.
