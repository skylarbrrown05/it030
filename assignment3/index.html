    TODO #1 (External CSS):
      Link to your external 'style.css' file here.
      For reference, see Chapter 5 about including CSS files.
  -->

  <!--
    TODO #2 (Internal CSS):
      Add an internal <style> block here with at least one rule.
      For example, you might style the <body> or <footer>.
      Refer to Chapter 5's section on using the <style> element.
  -->

</head>
<body>
  <!--
    TODO #3 (Inline CSS):
      Add a style attribute to at least one element, e.g. this <h1>.
      Example:
        <h1 style="color: blue; font-family: serif;">My Demo</h1>
      Then explain in a comment which Chapter 5 property/properties are used
      and how they might override the external or internal CSS if conflicts arise.
  -->
  <h1>Welcome to My Chapter 5 Demo</h1>

  <p>
    This paragraph should demonstrate <strong>inheritance</strong>.
    If you set a 'color' or 'font-family' on the <body> or a parent element,
    it should automatically apply here, unless it's overridden.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modify colors, fonts, text size, etc. in your external or internal CSS.
    Observe how the CSS cascade and inheritance affect these paragraphs
    vs. any inline-styled elements.
  </p>

  <!--
    TODO #4 (Demonstrate Cascade):
      For example, if your external CSS sets a color on <h1>,
      and your internal CSS sets a different color, see which one wins.
      Add a short comment explaining the result according to Chapter 5
      on the CSS cascade.
