    - Cascade (specificity, order)
    - Inheritance (how child elements get parent properties)

   doesn't override these styles)

    Add more rules if desired:
    - Paragraphs (p)
    - Footer
    - etc.

  /*
    For demonstration:
    - Show which rules get overridden by your internal <style> block
    - Which might get overridden by inline styles
    - Comment your observations about the cascade and inheritance
